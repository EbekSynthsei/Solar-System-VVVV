# VVVV Solar System
 A WIP Solar System reproduction to learn VVVV Nodes

It's a little project and will go further down the basics of the tool.

For now is just a test following their first step tutorial to get the Scene Window working and adding a little of what I learned using Unity and PureData.

I added some LFO and Waves to manage values of the PBREmissive Property, the rotation of the Sun and the Bloom Post FX.

Next step I think will be taking some inputs and moving the camera.

To open the project itself download and install vvvv and open the SolarSystem.vl file.
The .exe file should run with no problems, it's just a still scene with a rotating sun.
