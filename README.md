# VVVV Solar System
 A WIP Solar System reproduction to learn VVVV Nodes

It's a little project and will go further down the basics of the tool.

To open the project itself download and install vvvv and open the SolarSystem.vl file.
The .exe file should run with no problems, it's just a still scene with a rotating sun.

You can navigate around it by mouse. f2 will give you a performance meter and f4 a reference grid.

At the moment is a Sun with some particles floating around, from an emitter in the centre that randomly rotates to apply directional force in a 3d vector field filled with particles.
